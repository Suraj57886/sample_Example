VPC

aws->vpc->create vpc-> vpc name->cidr range 10.0.0.0/16

subnets->
create subnet->give subnet name for public->select created vpc->select A.Z -> provide cidr range 10.0.1.0/24

then to make it public-> subnet actions->subnet settings->enable auto assigning IPv4

then repeat same steps to create private subnet with private subnet name, created VPC, give private A.Z and cidr as 10.0.2.0/24 this time.


Internet Gateway->
internet gateway->create->give name->after creation attach to vpc

nat gateway->
nat gateway->create->give name->select public subnet->enable allocate IPv4->create button

route tables

first one->
route tables->create->rt-1>select created vpc->then edit subnet associations->
select public subnet->then edit routes->add route->dest 0.0.0.0 and target internet gateway

second one->
route tables->create->rt-2->select created vpc->then edit subnet associations->
select created private subnet->then edit routes->add route->dest: 0.0.0.0 and target->nat gatway


instances creation

we need three i.e web, db, baiston

for web and db use .pem and for baiston use .ppk
and while creating instances under network settings
give created vpc and public subnet for web and baiston instances
and created vpc, private subnet for db instance

then run WinSCP and give hostname of baiston instance->advanced->ssh->auth->credentials->
give .ppk of baiston->then in two tabs->
drag and drop .pem of db instance to right side


accessing instance->
now through putty connect to baiston instance->then sudo so
and then check with ls for .pem file
->then using ssh command connect to db_instance
->now install something like example: yum install git -y
